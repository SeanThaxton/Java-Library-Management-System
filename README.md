A Library Management System writen in java, for my FIU Programming 2 class. This assignment main focus was on the concept of inheritence in Object Oriented Programming.

This allowed for the very specific properties and attributes belonging to the specific libary item to be defined in their specific classes. Which improves coded readiblity, and mangament.
